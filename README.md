# Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the Mercedes-Benz testing system, reducing the time each car spends on the test bench. This not only speeds up the production process but also contributes to lowering carbon dioxide emissions, aligning with Mercedes-Benz's commitment to environmental sustainability.

## Problem Statement
Mercedes-Benz, a pioneer in automotive innovation, faces a challenge in optimizing the time cars spend on the test bench due to the complex configurations of features and options. To maintain their high standards of safety and efficiency, a powerful algorithmic approach is required.

## Objective
Develop an optimal machine learning model to predict the testing time for various configurations of Mercedes-Benz cars, thereby reducing the test bench time and promoting greener manufacturing.

## Steps to Perform
Data Preprocessing:

--> Remove columns with zero variance.

--> Check for null and unique values in both test and train sets.

--> Apply label encoding to categorical features.

Dimensionality Reduction:

--> Implement techniques to reduce the feature space while retaining essential information.

Model Building:

--> Use XGBoost to predict the testing time for different car configurations.

## Conclusion
This project intends to significantly cut down on the amount of time each vehicle spends on the test bench by putting in place an effective predictive model. This will lead to quicker production timelines and fewer emissions without sacrificing Mercedes-Benz's high standards.

## Impact

--> Speed: Faster testing times lead to more efficient production lines.

--> Sustainability: Reduced carbon dioxide emissions contribute to a greener manufacturing process.

--> Innovation: Continued commitment to safety and reliability through advanced algorithmic solutions.
